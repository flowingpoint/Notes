It's the Order! Your order, but the order you're in too. 	To save Dwarves! That's why we do deep dark dungeons with the team! Now things happen fast here so try to keep up, this ain't Saturday Night Tinsil Tennis, we're serious our artful ways in the underworlds. You remember Charon? Well, they know him, it turns out, they know his paths and his ways, they have to because they support all worlds with their lust for life, and the portable problems accompanied thereof. But just keep to the order and you'll be on the right track!
	The darkness consumes you, good thing you've a bit of work in there, now, because what have we learned? Darkness is M

	The ONLY missions are the ones you want to get over with SOON..... (soon and progress up the ladder to corporate or corporal or compadré)

	YSTYRY(TM). I do. I really do.

	You know what we build IS the visible nightmare, and the darkness is what YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT!

	It looked like that wasn't scary, but it actually was scary, ok? Might as well bean up. 

	This isn't something you can get in one take-away, it's got the look of the great one, but no matter how many reloads you got, it won't capture its essence. No that's alright, that's the order helping you out. 
	That's me being sexy, it won't survive in this world, you know? Only the order.

	I got my ass outta there, it was only a side mission.

	I look at my order, yeah it's complex 8. Haven't had these guys on board in a while. Look at that.

	That portal's open now, so they're gonna keep coming back. It's essentially about resources, like the guy who ... lost it and you're corpo, you can help. This IS thirsty work.

I know.
