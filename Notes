9:44pm Tuesday 2nd March 2024Examined Order Garden as Space Battleship, with interpretations: Top Arch as portal Captain Room Entry, Blue Octahedron as Water source Node, Dodecahedron as Engine or Nuke, Red Star on Spiral as gunnery vantage point, bare 4 corner standing stone could hold special sundial, compass, or BIGREDBUTTON. Page 6 has 2 emtpy spaces. Thinking of adding random looking grass frays above the Brush node and not the dual brushrock ones, and a rush node. Need to reduce itemfree node smash to close to nil. Want to make the 'Hui' rune functional as respawn point, or try again to have toggling glow effects. They were meant to be simple portals. 9:58pmIt is sinking.Looking over the surrounding levels, going down in steps of stories, like a crane peicing together the libraric Hallways and gardens of Babel. Looking to the stars for inspiration. Taking what is needed sometimes by question or argument with steady pluck from over the edge.10/4/24 3:54pm Work hours are very short, if any. Sent links: wall.pdf and drinkdamnation.pdf to two local villagers and Day of Jackal.mp4 to Suong, with bread plan set by Randark's 10 electrums.11/04/24 7:23pmHmm, feeling drained, sure I sweated getting my bed rotated, the curtains changed. Made record 41 seconds remaining for 'All you have to do is return these cars to their owners. Do it quick, and don't smash em up.' mission. Tamed the Champion Wolf in WO. Right let's get creating again. A short exercise. In Minetest again, there should be an animated dial that extends through four adjacent tiles, flat on the bottom of its box. Starting the 1x16 png. Since I've not done it before, I'll go with the regular size of tile. Then scale up by 2. Have done 12 points of a clockface, checking mbdx animation to double check frame count. 7:37pm.7:47pm 12 frames done.7:57pm Done, but it's only one tile. Want four intersecting tiles. Or 2.8:17pm Tweaking durations, 64 has a jump. Yikes,so does 24.Another jump. I've set it to 44=704/16. Jumps. should be around 704/12=58. Set to 60. 60.512/apr/24 4:47pm Shifted dial half unit to bottom left, but turns out the texture tesselates, so going to change animation and resize to fit as part of set of four on the time column. Making four dials, moving them from creative to runes. 4:59pm made the directioned regnodes in runes. 5:14pm Four directionals added. They overlap fine, as concentric diamond perimeters of four colors: red, blue, green, dark grey.17/Apr/24 5:15pm Thought this morning on a DM walk of the color wheels harbouring unifying fragments of an circumcircling bubble network. Each nodebox simply containing offset rectangles. If the rings were embossed outward, grooved outward to match a texture with a plain color background beyond the ring figure, on the central dial structure, but every other structure in the periphery was a solid cube minus the ring, it would also be capable of satisfying this bubble wall requirement, just the wall nodes would have gaps like the leaves do already in main minetest.18/Apr 2:05pm Estruck not star shaped enough: two vectors need shifting a little bit. But I'm kinda on holiday. Today I ventured into the abandoned house at the end of our street and found a moon ball, matching the ones delivered today along with loads of ...21/Apr 10:28am v1:->yz->={(-0.20991,-0.10073),(0,-0.25324)}l=√((-0.20991)²+(-0.25324+-0.10073)²)OR, each coordinate scaled seperately by ф:0.20991 x ф = 0.20991 x 1.618 = 0.33960.15249 x ф = 0.2467v = {(-0.20991,-0.10073),(0.3396,0.2467)} = {±0.12969,0.14597}Chnging ±0.12973,-0.40574 to that isn't right. Should be {±0.12969,-0.34743}.Wierd, changing the coordinates, funnily enough, doesn't change the starhole noticeably, after resetting and even renaming the obj file to 'estrucko.obj' but not the nodereg still presents the model in sim 11:10am It's cos I was testing in TJWIDE, but editing the minimal.22/Apr/24 Monday 7:43amMade D4.png, the master map of the four concentric unfinished columnar disc combination as crosshair node combination, or fcucdcacn, or 'fudan'. I wonder should I use mesh. What it should be is the selection and collission box is the corner.Lost the red disc now, having reduced the boxes to cover only the area on the pillar, and only one square,  because it has been cropped out doing this. Perhaps a pixel by pixel approach is cleanest? It's {32,28,24,20} pixels for them. That's doable. 8:15am One pixel done on red.9:04am... 10:43am Corrected missing decimal point in two or three locations following fudan pixel entries, which were causing the world to freeze on load. 10:49am renamed {dur,dul,dbl,dbr} to {0ur,0ul,0bl,0br}. This was so they'd appear together in the creative hud, but can be seen as signifying the origin as being essentially the natural crosshair at the centre of the concentric diamonds on the garden's token, a true node.11:00am number of pixels per ring: {20,24,28,32}, so I'll make the animations have that many frames each. 11:00 ur and br done but Thinkpad overheated and had to blink back.Since the orbital periods of the four inner planets of our solar system are {88,225,365,687} days, I'll just let the frame rate match, setting earth's to '1'. Mercury's is 88/365 of whatever earth is, but the ring ratio is 20:28 as well, so it's the product of those two fractions: 440/2555. Venus is 225/365 x 24:28 = 1350/2555, Mars is 687/365 and 8:7 so 5496/2555. 11:44am done. Well it's a bit fast so I'm setting it to 12 times that. Looks fine, though of course it jumps.9:42am 30/apr/24 3 textures of pock blanked out. Should update stones but can't find folder. 10:05am sorted. 10:13am got a recipe together for billboards. It's 6 white wool below, and a WW, grey brush, and empty book in any of 6 combos for the top row of the craft. 11:32am 1/5/24 added hexp, took longer than should have. Had to rush the sel/col boxes too.5:20pm Might look at corner joinder.7:03pm finishing sel/cols and rather than form another triangle, since it's getting hard to breath, I'm just using the sel/cols for aset, which is luckily oriented the same. 7:10pm Yeah tht'll do. hexar added.10:56am 2/5/24 Looking at gytul. If sel/col boxes expanded a bit, it'd be easier to manipulate. Gytul and gytur are composed of two triangle surfaces, which have well defined functions associated when rendered. The Δs are defined in standard xyz coordinates (that's where the coordinate marker diagram might display x,y,and z axes in an anticlockwise direction) as sets of three points where they intersect the boundaries of the nodespace unit in which they are positioned with param2 of 0. {(0.5,-0.5,-0.5),(0.5,0,0.5),(-0.5,-0.5,0)}, and {(-0.5,-0.5,0),(0.5,0,0.5),(-0.5,0.5,0.5)}. I'm concerned about the trade-off between ease of manipulation initially, and traversability, because when combined to form the basic structure for which it was designed, the gyroid, it may only come up just about to head height, and bigger sel/col boxes means less space to maneuver on the object. I'll save a copy of the sel/cols for it here in case it wants changing back.{-0.5,-0.5,0, -0.44,-0.44,0.06},{-0.227,-0.5,-0.227, -0.107,-0.44,-0.107},{0.107,-0.5,-0.393, 0.227,-0.44,-0.273},{0.44,-0.5,-0.5, 0.5,-0.44,-0.44},{-0.5,-0.227,0.107, -0.44,-0.107,0.227},{-0.227,-0.393,0.107, -0.107,-0.273,0.227},{0.107,-0.393,-0.06, 0.227,-0.273,0.06},{0.44,-0.393,-0.227, 0.5,-0.273,-0.107},{-0.5,0.107,0.273,-0.44,0.227,0.393},{-0.227,-0.06,0.273, -0.107,0.06,0.393},{0.107,-0.227,0.273, 0.227,-0.107,0.393},{0.44,-0.227,0.107, 0.5,-0.107,0.227},{-0.5,0.44,0.44, -0.44,0.5,0.5},{-0.227,0.273,0.44, -0.107,0.393,0.5},{0.107,0.107,0.44, 0.227,0.227,0.5},{0.44,-0.06,0.44, 0.5,0.06,0.5}Now for simplicity, I'm going to double the x and z widths of the sel/cols exclusively on the lower, flatter triangle, bringing those on the boundary inward, and see if it increases the density of sel/cols enough that it works for building. NO. Ideally, there should simply be more boxes added in the interstices between the bowling pin pattern already there. How many goes around ten with a shared border of 4? I can see where to put them. A reasonable way would be to identify two boxes in the line to be supplemented, and the calculations will be easier. I'll draw a picture, and simply label the vertices and correlete them with an index of the copied sel.cols I saved.6/5/24 10:26am Added s_52hul/r. Changed brushrock_8 to brushrock_c because it's curved, and making the corner brushrock the new brushrock_8 because the rock takes up 1/8 of the upper surface. 10:59am Brushrock_8 added. 11:45am What if the tiles correspond exactly with the fs in .obj? Worked for s_22. I could remove the 'g top... etc' lines from s_22. 11:53am Saved as (what it was) on desktop, removed them lines, put 'O cube' at top, cos it's on all of em. I suppose each category is ordered within its own group but they can mix and don't have to use a unique global ordering. 11:55am Checked and looks the same. Now I'll remove the 's off's. So I don't know what that does, but don't think I need it either. 11:57 Looks fine. But the s_21 is using the same texture on all sides. 12:03pm Perhaps I should split then the 2_21 into 7 sections like the s_22. But first, since it's far easier, I'll reduce s_22 the way s_21 was done, with the encoding running through vs,vts,vns,and fs for each face individually. I just bunched them together and can see the redundancy. 12:09 still works. What if I removed a 6th tile element from the regnode of something... say, brushrock_52ul? Took rock out. The front replicates the bottom. What is it? Top, bottom, right, left, back, front? Should do experiment to see what happens to, say, dice spots on a cube with variable texture set size. Doesn't nccessarily solve this one though. Taking out :"brushrock_9.png^[transformR90", "rushrock_9.png^[transformR270", "dirt.png^grass_side.png", "rock.png",  "rock.png","dirt.png^grass_side.png","rock.png","rock.png"and putting in just "rock.png" see does it recognise, then taking a break. Yes it does. Adding a texture to the tiles list: grass. No effect. Looks like it's just the first listed element gets duplicated. Doesn't happen to another one: s_22r, when "grass.png" added 5 times.minetest.register_node("stones:brushrock_21", {	description = "4Brush 3Rock /8",	paramtype = "light",	paramtype2 = "facedir",	tiles = {"rock.png","grass.png"},	groups = {cracky=3, soil=1},	light_source = 0,	drop = "stones:brushrock_21",	collision_box = {type="fixed",fixed={{-0.5,  -0.5,  -0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5}}},	selection_box = {type="fixed",fixed={{-0.5,  -0.5,  -0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5}}},	drawtype = "mesh",	mesh = "s_21.obj"})Not added. 12:23pm1:25pm Easiest way around this conundrum could be to use a conbined texture of double the resolution to map the vts to. ETA: 10 mins. 1:31pm made the double texture.So replacing out this:vt 0 0vt 1 0vt 1 1vt 0.5 1vt 0 0.5vt 0.5 0vt 0 1...f 1/1/1 5/2/1 4/3/1 3/4/1 2/5/1f 1/1/2 2/6/2 7/4/2 6/7/2f 2/6/3 3/2/3 8/3/3 7/4/3f 3/1/4 4/6/4 9/4/4 8/7/4f 4/1/5 5/2/5 10/3/5 9/7/5f 5/1/6 1/2/6 6/3/6 10/7/6f 8/6/7 9/2/7 10/3/7 6/7/7 7/5/7... done.1:46pm brushrock_21 added. 2:00pm Going to add the regular version of s_21. Done. Going to balance the r5/2 slope Lowhalf pyramid which is right with a left. 2:20pm Made png for s_52pl. 2:35pm rendered with a vertex a tad too high. Fixed and have 3 sel/col boxes to do. 2:53pm some redundancy noticed in the pyramid pair: got boxes could be made columns. 3:21pm s_52pl done. 3:41pm te last two, s_21 and brushrock_21 were the same obj. 3:49pm Touched up, and two blackpools down.7:51am Adding s_527l and r. Looks like it's another double sized texture. 8:09am Firefox won't open a png. Redoing vts and fs. 8:32 reverse orientation vt. 8:37am Done but no texture load because probable the reversed orientation segment. Shall have to reorient the parts of the texture quilt. 8:44am redoing vts. 8:54 done, but unknown node texture (moss). Looks like the convace face glitched out too. 9:06am updated to no avague. Maybe tiles has to be in a bracket. Slight chnge in the remaining skew on the two-part face of the error texture render. 9:09am yes, the green moss is gridded right, now to find out if I can get it to show properly as dual brushrock for the step into what was black pool but now is different because of the overlap which I don't like nd sort of want to quickly avoid seeing as Iruck out of the garden lickety-split on 3 roads... maybe today, maybe tomorrey, maybe next week... 'I got some' 'Sure was nice' 'I came up on the mountain, saw the rising sun, and I got some.... wow... satisfaction.. yes I did...' It's working now. 9:17am it's the other one gonna be used as a step.9:26 organized. 9:52am both brushrock r52 steps done. 10am gonna make diagsteps and it's right and left wallish banisters brushrock, and do a r5/2 lower part for normal step... 3:35pm Back from refreshing hike and redoing diagsteps to look similar to R2 Slope in menu. Ooops, before I input regular texture maps I gotta remember I've to use a double sized canvas with more types.4:27pm Some of the cycles defining the triangles of the double texture for s_2u, and the order of faces were irregular.Fixed both, but the slopey bit of the steps is invisible. 4:51 done. Doing L/R to Vert and Horz @5:15pm... 6:08pm four objs done. 6:12pm regnodes updated. Looks good but for missing Left to Vert. Just accidental renaming to 53lv. Fixed. 7:14pm s_21u badly glitched. 7:37 s_21u done for stone. Conbining s_2 and s_22. 8:28pm looks good and doing 3 basic rubble alterations. Well, was thinking of the R2 Slope, and the R5/2 Highhalf and Lowhalf, but now I'm thinking of rubble being like rubble and bumpy. Later. 8:35pm Combining s_2 and s_52, and rotating sel/col for that new Right to Vert but not now. 8:41pm8:07am 8/May/2024 Watched Fuller's Folly. 9:40am better do it. 9:44 Regnoded s_252. 10:23 r and l and despite flash restart made right obj not too tough. 10:39 both added. 52rv and 52rh diagsteps to be rotated in sel/col 90 degrees. 10:54am selcols for 52rv reverted back out on the lower slope, that means I accidentally went back in the neg x direction while tracing the slope line on coordinates, an easy error and easy to fix. 11:18am doing a half rubble (R2) would tidy up the pools, but should I make a way to tube-connect them away. On 166 for the menu too. So rubble has rock sides. Eh, maybe not. 11:33am. Crazy, but, let the rubble glow red. It's cracked the way the regular crack cracks green to bust a block, but this red'll be like coming in from the edges, and we can let the rest sit on it. Well, mde the animation still, 16, but maybe it should be blue rather than red. 12:24 kill two birds with the one stone: use pock under the dirt on all the grass? Bit confusing for newcomers. But it's a good one, what's the harm? Who needs to see the dirt at the bottom? Just have to change a few textures: ETA:3 hours. Another time, maybe. So I'll just leave the dirt visible underneath. Or have the rubble there. Hmm. Last node to add has to be rush. 12:35pm3:06pm Removed safety net, octas, took snapshot of full 7 pages of menu, copied out uploadables.12:35pm 9th May Must see if animated double sized texture may be used for an hourglass, and if the animation can be made to run on 'place'ing it. But which to try first? The texture check, the object model, or the logical test for placement? Another rather basic question for me is 'What's the maximum number of frames? (Oh, and to get the animation to run only once, of course.)Answers:[()a,()b,()c],[()=n],[()y,()n]1) Use blank faces intermittently if animated texture to animate appearance of rotations (eg a flag) while drawing from an obj.2)First try a basic animation on some obj, with a spool texture.10am 10/May/2024 made 100 numeral spool, but not added. To update this gytur and gyrul, the gyroid translational elements, takes a total of 60 sel/col boxes, all same size except for at the boundaries where there's only a half box but it connects with another half box when part of the overall gyroidal construction. 10:-5 so, just find the centres of each box, and the difference each is to be moved along their rows, there's two for each box.vertices that are already there so far, for creative:gytur:0.5,0.5,0.5-0.167,0.333,0.5 and 0.5,0.167,0.333 are on the same row, separated by three more cubes of diameter 0.120 each.The separation is (0.5-(-0.167))[≠/3 = 0.222≠]/4 = 0.1666 for x,[≠(0.167-0.333)/3 = -0.055 for y≠] 0 for y, and (0.333-0.5)[≠/3 = -0.055≠]/4 = -0.0414 for z. For the lower rows:I look for the third lowest z coordinate, where two sel/col boxes are on the same row, again seperated by three to add.0.167,-0.5,-0.167 and -0.5,-0.333,-0.167 have seperation:(0.167-(-0.5))[≠/3 = 0.222≠]/4 = 0.1667, (-0.5-(-0.333))[≠/3 = -0.055≠]/4 = -0.0414, 0, for x,y,and z, but hold on, shouldn'T the y-seperation be zero above? Correcting...(10:36am)-0.167,0.167,0.5 and 0.5,0.167,0.333 yeah.seperations: (0.222,0,-0.0555) for upper triangle,and ((-0.222,-0.0555,0) for lower triangle, starting at opposite boundaries for each, 15 above and 15 below. The starting vertices are:(-0.167,0.333,0.5), (-0.167,0.167,0.5), (-0.5,0,0.5) for upper,Shared are (-0.167,-0.167,0.333), huh never noticed before an extra sel/col that shouldn't be there, deleting it, there'll be an extra sel/col to add now,... so the other shared is just north of 0 but with lower y, (0.167,-0.333,0.167) for shared, and(0.5,-0.5,0), (0.167,-0.5,-0.167), (-0.167,-0.5,-0.333) for lower boundary accumulators. So the new vertices are:(-0.167+0.222k,0.333,0.5-0.0555k) -> {(0.,≠]but actually there are four incrementations counting the final vertex, so they've got to be divided by 4, not 3. 11:06am corrected. so(-0.167+0.1667k,0.167,0.5-0.0414k) -> {(0,0.167,0.459), (0.167,0.167,0.417), (0.333,0.167,0.375)}(-0.167+0.1667k,0.167,0.5-0.0414k) -> {( but I nissed that other one, turns out it was actually right, just there's only two to add and because there's no final vertex already there at the boundary I thought I'd start at the next one. That's why I was confused, it's fixed now. Here it is though: (0.167,0.333,0.5) +(0.1667,0,-0.0414)k -> {(0.333,0.333,0.459), (0.5,0.333,0.417)} and what I was doing: (-0.5+0.1667k,0,0.5-0.0414k) -> This one has 5 added {(-0.333,0,-0.459), (-0.167,0,-0.417), (0,0,-0.375), (0.167,0,-0.333), (0.333,0,-0.292), (0.5,0,-0.25)} There's one extra because of that one that was hovering above the surf.Then for the shared ones they go one way with one type of increment and the other way with the other corresponding type: 1x(-0.1667,0.0416,0) (+) (-0.167,-0.167,0.333) (+) 3x(0.1667,0,-0.0416) -> {(-0.333,-0.125,0.333), [], (0,-0.167,0.292), (0.167,-0.167,0.25), (0.333,-0.167,0.208)}The next ones have the same sel/cols to meet at the boundaries, but the increments are switched with 3x(-0.1667,0.0416,0) and 1x(0.1667,0,-0.0416) added to (0.167,-0.333,0.167) to make (the order doesn't matter so I'm writing them right to left) {(0.333,-0.333,0.125), [], (0,-0.292,0.167), (-0.167,-0.25,0.167), (-0.333,-0.208,0.167)}The lower ones: (0.5,-0.5,0) +(-0.1667,0.04167,0)k -> {(0.333,-0.458,0), (0.167,-0.416,0), (0,-0.375,0), (-0.333,-0.208,0), (-0.5,-0.167,0)}(0.167,-0.5,-0.167)+(-0.1667,0.0416,0)k -> {(0,-0.458,-0.167), (-0.167,-0.417,-0.167), (-0.333,-0.375,-0.167)}(-0.167,-0.5,-0.333)+(-0.1667,0.04166,0)k -> {(-0.333,-0.458,-0.333), (-0.5,-0.417,-0.333)}So the sel/cols go around these points with diameters of 0.12 each, to fit.For clarity, the points:{(0.333,0.333,0.459), (0.5,0.333,0.417)},{(0,0.167,0.459), (0.167,0.167,0.417), (0.333,0.167,0.375)},{(-0.333,0,-0.459), (-0.167,0,-0.417), (0,0,-0.375), (0.167,0,-0.333), (0.333,0,-0.292), (0.5,0,-0.25)},{(-0.5,-0.083,-0.333), (-0.333,-0.125,0.333), [], (0,-0.167,0.292), (0.167,-0.167,0.25), (0.333,-0.167,0.208)},{(0.5,-0.333,0.083), (0.333,-0.333,0.125), [], (0,-0.292,0.167), (-0.167,-0.25,0.167), (-0.333,-0.208,0.167)},{(0.333,-0.458,0), (0.167,-0.416,0), (0,-0.375,0), (-0.333,-0.208,0), (-0.5,-0.167,0)},{(0,-0.458,-0.167), (-0.167,-0.417,-0.167), (-0.333,-0.375,-0.167)},{(-0.333,-0.458,-0.333), (-0.5,-0.417,-0.333)}Different approach to gytul, for sense of freedom.

The easyporter as I tried it yesterday is one-way, but many-to-one and grouped by identification with an adjacent node that is the same for all easy-porters in the group, including the output portal. I want to change this to the node below the porter,and make the porter like a sticker or gem that goes on top of it, so for instance, a group of them is identified by the appearance of the runestone or step that has an additional marker. Also I want to use the particle effect of the magic mirror on this one, and I'm only using this one. So to do: a new texture and obj for the 2 porters, grouping by node type beneath rather than the 4 around, and reusing a particle effect from another mod.9:31am Looks like the 'node points' lines at the beginning of util.lua are the ones to change for job #2. Gonna change and check now. 9:33am Works. Easyporter is wonderfully simple, with the database a simple list of coordinates in a .json file in the world path.. Changing node timers from 0.1 to 2 at the top of the porter-in file to see does it incur small delay during or before port. Also tweaking so that player is ported to point 5 units higher than the out-port and the activation radius is lowered from 0.8 to 0.1. I see the texture is defined by a single tile, but will use a mesh. What about blackpool? Something like it maybe... Well, don't know why but maybe it's cos the activation radius is too low so I'll return it to ... no it's gotta be that they're activated by the player being 5 units bove the portal in. nope. Or should Ihve waited two seconds? Try these changes one at a time for clarity! Yeah, time delay is as seems and easily changed. 2 seconds should be proper. And the offset means that the portal can be a gem inset into an arched gate, with any chosen range, and delay. I think I'll do them in pairs then. If I use two versions of the portal, with different offsets, I can emulate the portal from minecraft, which has a delay of about 4 seconds. By using one portal at the top and another at the bottom of an arch, but having the meshes thin so that they only take up the space the player enters, the portals can be two-way, or even cyclic, which might be better. Is there another way to defing portal group? The out-portals are overhead and the in-portals are stepped on, but they are to be found together at an arch, so using a negative value for y in the 'tp-to-portal' function in util.lua, I believe I have set the output location to be below the out-portal gem. But is there a way to do it with just two pillars? How about blue flame? Since the portal is activated by the snoo powder in HP which turns fire blue. Ideally, blue fire stays blue for a short time, and turns red. The portal node should be a decoration above the fire but in the fireplace, and port to another blue flame, so let's have that a blue flame only turns red a little while after some player has passed through that node. 10:18. Later. 1:21 played piano. line 125 to 152 returnmirror/init.lua.... going to use hui rune. Should be scope would work WITH the teletool. 2:05pm Should have unlit rune goes to lit rune. Not using dice, unless don'T mind adding another? Then runes require something below them that is the same. Would be nice then to use blackpool as a red gem instead, and as in-portal, with dice as out-portal. Want all runes identifyable? Nah, keep em seperate... I could have the portal activation zone large, and beneath the floating island of Winde, and last long enough so that no matter how player falls, always ends up at respawn point. Is that a good idea? <nods>. We'll see though, gotta just get blackpool to dice portal tested first. 2:32pm ok, have mirrored, or parrotted, the easyporter into the 'tool' mod folder of RSWO minimal, with 'easyporter' changed to 'tool' in function definitions, and blackpool and dice taking the place of portal-in and portal-out. Reduced area of blackpool. There was a 'failed attempt to index local 't', a nil value, but I looked at the init and found there was no 'tool = {}' thee. Fixed. 2:40 well it says 'set portal:hui' but no teleport yet. Whoops, clumsy me, forgot to change y to positive again, since these are runes for standing on, not as part of an arch portal. Wouldn't want to be dropped into the abyss, now would we? :/ ... Well, it worked, after some jumping... What about having the blackpool be kind of green and shoot sparks? I'll use the candle texture from TJ. 2:55pm But Ihave to find it. Later. Or I'll just go in and check. It is default:torch, there. It goes out after less than a minute, it would be great if the portal was only active that long after being placed. If I'm using floo spew it should really be output, and dice input. It turns to real_torch:torch. Maybe blackpool should turn to 'air'? Then it should stay as input. Either it's input and turns to air, or it's output, in which case: how is it placed? Ideally, it's input, turns to dice, and the output, dice, turns to blackpool, which has a node timer that turns it to air. It turns to dice when used as input, and becomes an output, and vice versa, but it's like a whole week of work and I don't know if I can cos I've a sore back even though that's perfect, and I can see how it would work... So I'm just making it look like fizzly torch, but bluey green. Anyway I guess I'll switch dice to input and blackpool to output, which kinda makes me look evil, but it's just because.... ok, I'll try node-time the blackpool to air sometime when I have time, but, I'm just switching their roles for now. Ok, fixed. I know: I'll reverse the direction of the smoke effect, making it look like it's being 'sucked'. 3:55pm done. 14/May/2024 7:42pm I guess I'll try and do some mathematics. Hmm I've decided the job is to map out the bed locations and orientations for a complete cell of the gyrominoes, using the excel datasheet for Tinny Jangle but later.... 17/May/2024 8:14am half R5/2 + skewslab half for bridge banister. 12:44pm added to r5/2 bridge, drew half dozen hypothetical pngs, would Iwant an 8th pg. Wish to make bush invertible. 7:37am Saturday 18th: Changing shrub paramtype2 from 'meshoptions+ to 'facedir' so I can turn it upside down and make it visible roots. place_param_2 was 4. paramtype2 = "meshoptions",place_param2 = 4,Reverted. 7:44. Noticed Jel faces player. Could easily do that the mobs hold staffs and the staffs are the only interactible things. Can't see difference between sprites that seem to face player and those that don't, not in the sprites.lua file. 9:44am removed scaffold, R52 bridge has rune portal and snakey banister pot.12:22am played piano and ready to try animating a mesh using animated textures for the vts in an obj. See the runes use animated textures, now I just have to find out if mesh based nodes can use them, then it's a matter of creating multiple intersecting (ETA: 2 hours) closed volumes which take an opaque subsection of the texture (which will be a double-sized one with a blank area, perhaps in the middle) for a subset of the frames. I'll start simple with an experiment: using a 32x32 animated texture for a basic model 12:27pm. 12:40... The pedestal animates a 'weilditem' visual, but that isn't a drawtype in the mod book. Just thought of a fountain type thing, the color within could obviously be animated, and it could be really simple to start off. Do I want to do a fountain shape? like a bowl but using a blue texture inside, or do Ijust want to go and get an actual glass of water in real life?...9:02 forgot animation but looked at sun... after several hours of the screen and judging the whole thing. Yeah, I don't know, ya know, it's a long way to Kansas.9:27am Sun 19th The arches clipped but circumcentral approximations made in z/16s, so the vns are simple roots, and it's smoother: ETA:1.2 hr each.21/5/24 8:32am along the (-x,y) plane it goes: 0,0		1,4		2,7		3,8		{4,10	≠5,11≠	6,12}	8,13	9,14	12,15	16,16	in sixteenths.	 8:52am png done, 22 vertices. so what are these in decimal? {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}/16 = {0.0625,0.125,...} Oh wait I know these already :). 9:=5am started stitching three faces at a time like this: vt 0 1vt 0 0vt 0.0625 0.25vt 1 0vt 1 0.2577vt 0 0.2577vt 1 1vt 0.9375 0.25vt 0.125 0.4375s offf 21/1/1 1/2/1 3/3/1f 1/2/2 2/4/2 4/5/2 3/6/2f 22/6/3 4/7/3 2/4/3f 21/1/4 3/3/4 5/8/4f 3/... but because the heights are actually different for the slopes and the vertical sides as you go around because the slopey height is what is meant by 'height' is the surface distance so it's a bit more and when you have them listed together it's not actually much easier than doing each type of surface seperately (There's more similarity to connect adjacent figures). So, using a calculator, {√17/16,√10/16,√2/16,√5/16,2√2/16} = {0.2577,0.1976,0.0884,0.1398,0.1768} and cumulatively from the bottom edge of the middle strip going down it's gonna be:{0.7423,0.5447,0.4563,0.3165} Oops wrong way around- it's:{0.8602,0.7719,0.5742,0.3165} then for the 2√2 which is 2.8284... just use three pixels and go up from the top edge of the middle strip with {0.1398,0.2281,0.4258,0.6834} and I guess take the middle strip from the bottom and remember the lower strips are in reverse order to the way they're listed. 1:10am all's left is the vns. {(-4/√17,-1/√17,0), all the zs are 0, (-3/√10,-1/√10), (-1/√2,-1/√2), (-2/√5,-1/√5), -(1/√2,-1/√2), (-1/√5,-2/√5), (-1/√2,-1/√2), and the rest, you know...10:22am obj done, now to sort of halve the sel/col boxes. whopper cool, but 10:29 two textures inv. No just didn't add them. 10:33 added. Just want to reduce by 1/32 toward nearest edges. Done 10:37am4:41am 22/5/24 vertices for acro done.4:55 for slopey sides pixels outward from top and bottom edge of middle strip, with having them sort of converge to unity. I thought there would be a need for compression due to some R2 plane but no.{0.3165,0.5742,0.7719,0.8602} v{0.1398,0.2281,0.4258,0.6834} ^The coordinates of vertices on the four lower and upper edges of the slopey section, going in +y direction. But note it's not along the diagonal, but actually the arch interpolate, those /16s. 6:00am trifracs and vts done. vns are same as for arch. 6:13 arco: rendered somethin funny above. Somehow it's all curved inward. No vertices are given greater than 0.5 y value coordinates, but it looks like it goes up to about 0.9, and the two flat sickle shapes are curved towards a point that high above the centre. The curving is regular though. The slopey sides have only a couple faces skewed in texture but the back flats are busted. So first do the odd repair in the slopes' textures. Ah! 6:29 29th vertex added. So that's what happens when a vertex is missing. It looks ok really, it has character. 6:32am. Looking at the sel/col boxes for arco I'm seeing the z values go pos to neg reading left to right. Iguess it works that way too? Fixed. 'Ya gotta thin the top one by half and raise it by half'. Bringing the sel/cols toward the surface as much as I can while keeping the rationals low. 6:49am Arco done.9:27am already started labelling them face-wise, rather than by altitude. Keepin it. Then again no harm changing it if I can. Changing it BACK isn't really changing it though, it's a... kind of a local change but global conservativeness. 9:31 done. 10:26am done. arco was useful for copying (with a slight re-ordering) the vns. 10:30 well it's wierd lookin. 10:34 was missing top vertices, fine now with a smudge here and there that adds some character. 10:#5 again, in sel/co.s flattening it towards the flat faces half a 16th in three directions: x,y, and z. 11:07 we5ll see what the modified nodeboxes look like, then we might get rid of them altogether. Well, it's done, and I suppose nb remains as an historical expression, if a little overly visible in the code, I suppose it's easily fixed in some other word proccessing method. Now to alter the .obj for arch to fit the half-width model for arsh. 11:27 saved copy of arch as arsh on Desktop. Just bring all the negative 'z's to zero. change vts from 0 to 1 for the slopes. move arsh to model folder. 11:38am I suppose next is to fix the other spiral staircase step. spirout_l. later---5:24am9/4/25Bit of route No.7 completed. I guess No.6 is next. Needs single page/scroll writing. Other languages even. Another non-physical: rotated graffiti, but chalk. Chalkify it. Also, i LIKE THE WAY ITEMS UNLINKED TO THE FLATo HOLDER FALL IF THE TUBESEG IS ORIENTED HOLLOW FACE DOWN, SO THAT THE ITEM FALLS. iT'S A CLASSIC MINIMAL INVENTORY. Electrical lightning strike animation for thunderstaff maybe, but that's just waffle stockpiling. Should be able to toggle those of the Knight's Leap Stairset (KLS32) which have partial volumetric closure on the external sides of the banisters to have it via some 16 additions in not in Cinventory, when doing models again.9:32am Sore leg. Ready to start. 10:11 discerned orientations. checked, is right-handed after all for objs. 10:34am forked c8l2C.Say C for Co-Volume, the cover that completes the volume (at least on one side of the banister. this way there'll be compactness where one side of the staircase is walled in a strong sense, grid-like. updating selcols, and po for sto6.lua's clone nodereg. 10:43am done. nothing happened because I forgot to reference the mesh in reg and also to add the obj file to the models folder. 10:47am done, it appears, but still have to clone the selection box from the collision box, because I still see the nodebox lines on the model in render. 10:49am It was the positive Zs not the negatives to be blocked closed. 10:51 done proper, looks decent, of course, it could only aim to be exactly as expected, in fairness. Toggles with popper, obviously, and I suppose I should have a rubble version toggleable with rubler. 10:57 done. Great!12:06pm c8l4C done. 12:30pm two more done, new angle, wondering about rubbled vol toggle, probably add later? Or now? 12:33 done. It's 'all the negative Xs up to zero' now.12:48pm first c8laC done. 12:52pm made use of find and replace to streamline the now 4 dimensional set of 16 indices in popper add-ons. 13:02pm c8lbC done.13:27pm c8ldC done, after adjusting faces with imprecise knowledge of the vertex identification maps, taking time to solve a good puzzle. 13:40pm switching the staffs is like streetball cool. 13:56 Said hi to guy from Barnados Street crew with sunglasses, because it IS a sunny day out, but Penny cut everything short, and the work goes on undiminished. 14:15 c8r4C done. Spaghet's coming! 14:31pm c8r6 and listening to HankG on synthetic species eduinfocornermebob. 14:35 can't say I'm 100% but I think it's important to be precise and respect the science nomenclature, the method, the knowledge, which so well is here. 15:11pm c8raC done. 15:12 Lunch, having Delicious Salmon Spaghetti and prob have to leave the rest for the day after it, will want to walk or something. 16:10pm suppose I'll look at the last three this sesh.

There is a possibility of figuring out how to get automatic respawning of the item after withdrawal, but later. When an item-stocked flat_O is rublified, either it pops out to roughly where the 'row' made contact (this can be math.floored in the 'drop item' part of sus that's explicitly used in rubler interaction list of po.lua) with no ghost if it's center face or close to segment entrance and the item lies somewhat in contact still with some horizontal part of the flat_O. Either that or it drops away from it and the ghost remains, which is a niusance because it's misleading in that it looks like an item is available so the information is lost. 19:30 I've just checked and where the item drops is independant of the ghost item's remaining or not.19:48 Want to use the simplicity of stones:flat_O reg's 'on_rightclick' function for 'row' during rublification.Dump:after 'if s.name == "stones:flat_O" then'local meta = minetest.env:get_meta(pos)    	if meta:get_string("item") ~= "" then    		if self.nodename == "stones:flat_O" or "stones:flart_O" then    			minetest.env:add_item({x=math.floor(pos.x)+0.5,y=math.floor(pos.y)+0.5,z=math.floor(pos.z)+0.5}, meta:get_string("item"))    		end    		meta:set_string("item","")        end        local objs = nil        objs = minetest.env:get_objects_inside_radius({x=pos.x,y=pos.y,z=pos.z}, 2)        if objs then            for _, obj in pairs(objs) do                if obj and obj:get_luaentity() and obj:get_luaentity().name == "stones:item" then                obj:set_properties({textures={"air"}})				obj:remove()                end            end        end        meta:set_string("item","")in po.lua under 'row' entity reg. Similarlylocal meta = minetest.env:get_meta(pos)    	if meta:get_string("item") ~= "" then    		if self.nodename == "stones:flat_O" or "stones:flart_O" then    			minetest.env:add_item({x=pos.x,y=pos.y,z=pos.z}, meta:get_string("item"))    		end    		meta:set_string("item","")        end        local objs = nil        objs = minetest.env:get_objects_inside_radius({x=pos.x,y=pos.y,z=pos.z}, 0.5)        if objs then            for _, obj in pairs(objs) do                if obj and obj:get_luaentity() and obj:get_luaentity().name == "stones:item" then				obj:remove()                end            end        end        meta:set_string("item","")in stones:flart_OBack to the way it was and there's no itemdrop, but now I'll simulate rightclick with it instead and might have more luck with the ghost. the confusion must be arising from the fact that the interaction isn't securely localised at the static node as it would be if it were an 'on_rightclick' application, it is an interaction between a projectile entity and a static object, which has some kind of ambiguity about the locations that are called at various parts of the code I'm trying to use ot emulate a rightclick. drop_item, update_item, remove_item are all functions of position and node. Remove identifies the node and removes the entity within a radius. If a ghost remains but an item doesn't, it must have worked, but there's no concrete definition for a ghost item in the standard code, so the question arises: what is the ghost and how is it simulated on purpose? Update makes the metastring of the node correspond with the visible texture of stones:item, which I think is always there, either as the metastring, which derives from right-click interaction only thus far, and is otherwise 'air', ie: empty. Update begins with item removal but not changing the metastring, because 'remove' doesn't change the metastring, and therefore it is possible to use update to respawn the item. I have also noticed invisible item storage following increased range removal, with rightclick retrieval and timed re-appearance, probably due to the abm, which 'updates' from the metastring. Then 'drop' is that the item pops out as can be picked and the metastring is cleared, as well as the entity is removed.Using these few clarifying definitions how would you classify a 'ghost'? It's an entity, but rightclick doesn't drop item and removes the entity. If the metastring is not empty, the abm will respawn it. In the cases where ghost appears, it's like 'drop' without the 'remove' part, that is, the metastring is cleared. 20:18 ghost appearance has also metastring clear, so 15second interval abm refreshing the item...pos is position of projectile impact, and that's also iffy, but it's generally somewhere around the target node, right? so drop uses 'minetest.env:add_item({x,y,z},item) and the x,y,z there is the projectile 'row' wherever the hitnode is effected. This is why the drop happens at that point, it is noticeable. However, sometimes it is outside the node and falls away, which implies that the if statement in 'drop' is not satisfied when the drop occurs, so in that case self.nodename or node.name isn't flat_o and must be air. Then why does a drop happen? 'row' has non-negligible volume, cubic side length of 0.4. Clearly, if hitnode in 'row' is a function of the position of the entity, and whenever this is called there's no garuantee that it intersects the node that it supposedly impact, which is always used as the other argument in the function which makes it work to toggle them, it would be almost better if the pos argument of 'row' was made to be the position of the node argument, but I think that is set in places in the code, let me have a look. lose_player should work to effect ranged annihilation of 'row', and otherwise an abm would work, as had been applied to 'pew'. Anyway I'll want an expression to extract the position of 's', the result of s = minetest.env:get_node(self.object:getpos()) as written in hitnode. It seems to 'get the node' that is at the position of the entity object that hitnode is written for, and hitnode only applies once a node is at that position, so I would deduce that a node is designated to be at the position of the moving entity by wirtue of collision detection and not of intersection of its logged coordinates with the node's unit volume. I have clarified an if statement to have the full equality of the truth value written out each side of 'or' because I think when you have 'if (expression) it is implied the question is of the truth of the statement rather than the more specific identification with the thing on the other side of the equality. Anyway, now the object just dissappears. Sorry, doesn't drop, and ghost problem is same, otherwise I'd consider it. But it means also that self.nodename isn't the self in question, which makes sense since it's an entity, not a node. what I want is s.name there. It's the way it was 20:58 now when it was taking 'if "stones:flart_O"' as the full logical conditional. What could it mean? I have removed '	obj:remove()' from the 'remove' part of it, and in this case it leaves an 'air' stock texture that is visible as the thing that has 'air' written on it, but the ghost problem is the same with a semblance of the item removed.Is 'meta' a property that can be initialised alongside param2 in the original rublification toggle placement, the 'setnode'? Actually I want to keep the item there, that's all, or maybe have it come out for flat to flart, but not on the repair. So what's the simplest way to do that?21:12 21:27 just... made a mess... spawning 'air' textures, ang an 'always ghost' on repair. That's because I'm just copying the remove part of update, I don't have to. 21:29 removed it and it behaves the same. I'll try an abm to have if metastring is empty to remove the object, the entity, the stones:item hopefully, then we'd have 'drop'. I wonder if an abm could by chance apply during an intermediate step in one of the other functions, or is it always designated its own time, I suppose it would be. Should have that if it doesn;t have an object, then update the metastring ot air...? What causes the ghost again? 21:41 I see my new abm at work, producing by itself an 'air' texture in the flat_o. now just to set it so that it does this for ghost, and have the texture be invisible. I'll go with... hmmm. it keeps spawning air textures because the abm was to do that if the metastring was empty, in which case air is read the same as empty. It forms a dense cylinder, blue, over time, kinda neat, like canisters absorbing oxygen into a tank or whatnot... It's still 'empty'. It doesn't replace 'ghost, but adds more 'air', so I want to change the abm to make it instead remove whatever's there being visible. Hmmm... 'remove_entity isn't in the minetest.env reportoire... But at least it adds the entity of 'air' dead centre of the node, because the abm applies directly to nodes. 21:58 so I threw in 'remove' into the abm and it worked! took               obj:set_properties({textures={"air"}}) out of the abm, but left the rest in. Only thing is the items, when they are in the tube, blink out and back after a second or two with the same frequency as the abm. Well best I can do is there'll be a ghost for a few seconds after rublification or repair, but the abm clears it. And sometimes, there's no ghost! 22:13pm7:47am 10/4/25 diagsteps 52s clipped and set clipped one as inventory item. Perhaps a few cycles are in order.9:32am done S and Z diagste(r)ps 58, allowing smoothness all round the KLS32. 9:49am I think I should re-label these four before I do a whopper change, even if it means replacing the mogly nodes they'll make in the world Order, which, to be fair, is not a big deal at all since it's so minimal. But I want to label stairs 'going in' to vert or horiz as the closest orthogonal plane to the slopes drawn from the sided 3/4 elevation of the standard looking step, then with one pair i'll have 7/8 and the other a half volume incorporating opposite angled lower and upper r52half-slopes which would be good and kept off menu.

Ah, it's the toy 'OPS-M.R.P CAL.45' plastic, imported, green pump-action cover finish, water sport children's toy issue, fits in the hand, clean effects, light and slightly damaged, so that it wets the holster until I get it sealed.

In any case, it works perfectly, just that there are 4 extra items with no intention of being called in rswo, from the original rhotator, that I can remove here before further updates to avoid clashing with the author of rhotator. Also there's a 'complex' library added alongside the 'matrix' library that didn't call properly. The files needing update are: tools/{init,complex,matrix,rhonch,(maybe wrench)}.lua, two mods: 'rhotator', and 'matrix', sitting heavy bringing the modcount to 12.12:31pm 25/4/25 Just watched 'They cloned Tyrone'. Well I think I want the floor to be a bunch of mazes, like, going down, like an inverted climb, but a different shape of hallway collections each floore, I think that would be a nice way to challenge myself, after all, it wouldn't be too stressful a mission to complete a level each play, would it? It only has to be walls too, not neccessarily ceilinged, and any new ideas can fall to the next level, and then each floor has an entrance and exit, but also it fills the gap, to an extent, doesn't it? So it'll look nice from the outside, and on the inside it's a classic, but it remains then to accept the cliche and grind it from the first, and maybe a few good designs can trickle back up. I got the idea from this carpet pattern the protagonist is dragged by after he's shot in the film I just watched, it's a tesselation of octagonal spaces linked to neighbours, and disjoint encirling ones, bright yellow on black, and it's easy enough, because lets' face it, this multi-level shopping mall stuff is way out of my reach if I'm doing all this philosophizing. I should even do up a plan beforehand, with the floorspace included. But that's next week, or something, because I have had enough of it this week, after spilling my guts and making a show of it to Dermo. Besides, just a floor each session, that's reasonable, that's the way these things are meant to be played aren't they, I mean, when you clearly aren't Mr. Goodhope saving the damsel and saving the world. Even just a few starter levels would be right, a right job. Sheesh, I am fucking exhausted.On the other hand, I've also just downloaded some 'Alien' game and want to check it out and see if it works. Man I'm so goshdarn decadent. I don't know what's more evil, the building or the playing. I mean, what in tarnation are we gonna make that is actually a genuinely good thing, because I can't get away from the meat either when I'm deep in the work, and I don't want to be all taking these offerings against my style of personality development, my social enquiries, my open book ethical standard of discourse, wow there are so many good things I have to say about myself. But then again, the question is what makes you a good person, because it's like, you can do a good thing, or you can have a good thing, but something I haven't tried is this Alien game and to be honest, it's probably the best experience, but am I going to be able to play it the way I want or am I just going to be yo-yo-ing between that and the build and then just decide that it's all meaningless? How do I know the aliens are bad? How do I know I'm going to be sprinting around with loads of cavalry all day with some rad skins in space? But I mean, I don't do skins, do I? I buy skins, but I don't make them. I don't have a skin system, I mean, and I never did, but someone is having to smooth it all out for everyone else, and maybe I know enough about the stones anyway to be able to look at literally anything else, but then obviously there are a few questions I should ask, perhaps in the build I do, like do I really think that it's 'all skins'? Could the universe be 'just skins'? I mean that's like saying it's 'all atoms'. but, yeah, it is, but there's patterns of nature too. It's just, in nature there are levels of patterns all the way down to the atoms, but in games it's no longer a physical level, and the naive approach is punished with existential angst. You think you are a master of alchemy and substance but you still have to beg for the gange, because you ... you can't even wrap up a level, never mind a skin of a cloak and dagger celebrity. But if you want to go down the road of skin acknowledgement there's a rich tapestry of delusion that might make your world for you, all you have to do is be honest and subscribe to that 'theory of skins' and write your damn thesis in the world and see how much discord it causes amongst the locals who have lived in those places for a long time. Like, does anyone really want to get into arguments about it with you, I mean you're so softly spoken. Go back to your stones.19:21pmTime for gardening then. Just watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZkYcFM8yfkfor inspiration.

Discovered another update by nininik.11:07 Tidied up 'noter', a further shortening of nininik's add-on 'homedecor_books_2', which might be further replenished with hovertext, but is not lacking much else, and is colored black to reflect the strange desire to remove color, I guess until drawing becomes available in book form.

Reminds me I should investigate cryptographic locking, unlocking and hacking, all deep subjects.17:02pm want way to quick remove entity, for koin throw, bubble loss, things falling off the platforms... Should use 'clear.lua' somehow...17:11 fixing blushrock_8, patch at {-0.5,-0.5,0, -0.5,-0.25,0.5}{-0.5,-0.5,0}--#86{-0.5,-0.5,0.5}--#3{-0.5,-0.25,0.5}--#97{-0.5,-0.25,0}--#96F#12{vt 0.25 0.125, vt 0 0.125, vt 0 0,vt 0.25 0} is ok 17:28 have re-checked several times... Am sure vertices are labelled correctly, texture is mapped correctly, no typos anywhere, vertex normals are correct. The glitch has the corner three stitched ok, with a sort of drag of what's outside of that triangle off into some point contained within the volume, and the tip of some other portion possibly on the same somewhat askew plane that glitches out from the triangle, close to the z=-0.5 plane and internal to the volume, also triangular. In fact it exactly touches the plane at {-0.25,0,-0.5}. A quick search yields no vertex with these coords.An alternative to vt{1,2,102,101}: {0.875 0, 1 0, 1 0.25, 0.875 0.25} => {99,6,7,100} Now It could be a typo resulted in an extra face-index '12'. Nope. 17:42Now that's a real mess. f 88/1/26 1/2/26 93/102/26 101/7/26vn 1 0 0Took this out like a panel on an electric device, sure is satisfying, and I realised that the vn was indeed reversed, being on the tail end of a set of x+ normals, just before the chain of x negatives. so...vn -1 0 0goes back in.More confusion: On the opposite side, that is, 180 degrees rotating about the x,z=0 axis, of the glitchy patch aforementioned, is what looks to be a 90degree off rotated patch, giving 4pixel where it should be eight in length and vice versa. However when checking the vertex mappings I note that a vertex, precisely the one that went missing on the other side, is labelled the next vertex on the list from what it should have been (101 instead of 100) and the one it was labelled as is located on the z=0.5 plane and similary opposite from the point on the z=-0.5 plane where the glitch triangle reaches to, the point WITHOUT a vertex representation on the obj file. This is extremely confusing.I will fix the 90deg-off patch vertex map error and see what happens. For some reason, due perhaps to the symettry of the anomoly, I am hopeful to see a complex result. I should think any correction fixed is an improvement.18:04pm It has, on the other side, taken the glitch triangle back to the quad, and I now think this is clearly a texture has gone off up across the mapper, that would be why there is this opaque trapezoid before a grey rock bit, then a dirt tip of the triangle: it is mapping a concave quadrilateral as two triangles. Further, there is a clear mirroring of the patched triangle above the triangle's boundary and a skew, so one could infer that the rock and dirt triangle tip at the fourth vertex is mapped from a point quite far and probably external to the texture mapper png file square, at least coordinate-wise, and this coordinate could indeed be discerned in render, should I? IT seems to be about {x,y}->{-x,2x+ay}Also m=y/x is 3/8, that's the slope of the transformed positive y vector, so a=8/3. Hence the fourth vertex, being at, if we suppose the bottom left corner is {0,0}, it's at {0,4}, and the mapping takes, to choose a few convenient points, {8,3}->{4,4-8/3=..So I start at some point I can identify both sides of the glitch-map, and choose a vector in the glitch, and seek the inverse glitch of it. I do this from {5,2} and it multiplies length by about (4/5):5.3 ~ 1:6.6 and the glitch path length is about SQRT[18]-(2/5) ~ 3*1.4-.4 ~ 3.8, so the domain distance is 6.6 times that, 25.08, and the direction has slope about 3/10 so from {5,2} add {25|x,25|y} ~ {31,10} and to note that the domain was a patch from the bottom left of the vt, nearest the origin, so the local pixel coordinates ring true, and a vt has size 16x16, therefore the point is roughly at {31,10} which could be ~ {15,10} and that is probably {16,10} You know, I noticed some non-linearity so I wouldn't be surprised if it's just {16,16}, the top right corner of the vt mapper, which would explain the rock to dirt tip of the triangle, but not the lack of blush pocks dotted throughout the central area of the texture mapper, the lack of intermediate pixels between the reflected triangle that patched ok and the triangle tip that mysteriously mapped to the fourth vertex when the vertex indices on THE OPPOSITE SIDE of the rendered node were corrected.Anyway, plan B is to use two triangles.An attempt shall use all standard assumptions.18:54, interestingly, the inversion continues, after the quad was replaced with two triangles, I'll have to now translate my corrections in accordance with this glitch language, but I would doubt that I would have a perfect result unless I perhaps don't upload and try render even on the other pc laptop just to see if it's an interpretation issue that could be looked into in spite of it seeming to be not very world-buildy.I'll rotate the triangles, because there's still the 4-8 switched. 2-1 patch coords: {6,7,100,99} or {1,2,102,101}Fixed with f 86/6/12 3/7/12 97/100/12 96/99/12Now for other side, the one with the glitchy triangle.[[[f 88/1/26 1/2/26 93/102/26 100/7/26]]]f 88/1/26 1/2/26 93/102/26 100/101/26That was the error.

Brush gets one too. 19:23 made it random, about corresponding axes, so if the one is sideways, the other is same way sideways.19:35 completed an absent rublification on (b)rushrock_52ur.I think I'll put a symbol next to the menu items that toggle with the pop/rub staff, like a star and the cycle order for the hover field.Hey I should see if I can change the hovertext color for those ones that cycle. 20:05 done.Tried     on_rightclick = function(player, clicker, pointed_thing)		set_sky(494125, skybox, {"tess.png","tess.png","tess.png","tess.png","tess.png","tess.png"})in tess.7:42am 1/5 Notice in rswo_addons/pole.lua's pol.obj (and elsewhere) that face trifracs from blender not including face indices work, and high number of edges for cap and base polygons sit on the same line in the trifrac list as fine as dansy. But would it work for concave faces? If not why not? It should.8:47am Found 'tape-measure' mod by OgelGames. Looking for true path length, but this is still great!15:20pm I notice repeated trifrac indices and think they are meant to be different faces corresponding to the same vector normal. Isn't that swell? All they need is probably that little 'f' at the start of the line.16:05pm It's just all black now.12:27pm 4/5/25 added c8r1t and c8l1t and disgsteps_34l.

Will I be ready for that?14:40pm going to put lightning in the mods folder (I have it somewhere) because it was like the first thing I thought of this morning and also because I might challenge myself with an attempt at lightning effects, but really what you want is to build a few static (they sort of have to be static though) nodes of animated (of course) textures but with lightning forking like branches, but it'll for sure be a system based on sub-collections of paths between some division of integral lattices.15:45pm done with diagsteps_r2p.obj and I'm uploading and feeding my mind a bit.22:50pm 8/5minetest.register_node("stones:knight",{	description = "Knight",	inventory_image = "knight.png",	drawtype = "mesh",    mesh = "knight.obj",	visual_scale = 0.7,	tiles = {"rock.png"},	paramtype = "light",	paramtype2 = "facedir",	groups = {cracky=1, not_in_creative_inventory=0},	drop = 'stones:knight',	light_source = 0.5,	use_texture_alpha = "clip",	selection_box = {type = "fixed", fixed = {-0.1, -0.5, -0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1}},    collision_box = {type = "fixed", fixed = {-0.1, -0.5, -0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1}},})unused knight              Knight23:08 but DID dl black mirror and add 'hudi', the solidus snake statue bust to face the pods, and it looks perfect, and may have a use... like game-istically, someday.14:30 9/5/25Serious cosmetic improvements: Hex could be endowed with a window alt, slab could carry some tiling tesselations: the papernotes have a dual hexagon pattern and I intend for it to be impressed up to the borders, but stopped there, perhaps with gradual slope to surface and all, because it's only a rough idea hewn onto broadly ignorable grey backgroundspace, isn't it? Well, no, it's a 'serious cosmetical improvement'. And another thing: the dual hex should place according to parity of coordinate for ease of matchup, but that's much later, I can obviously just rotate them, no that's what I mean, the paramtype could be... but of course you want the choice aswell, unless you're mad into big flat tiled spaces but that's your own doing, what can I say, don't go overboard! Simple engraving effect is about 30 faces I'd say.13:41PM The Saturday afternoon chill session. gonna shift four verices: should be a half a pixel each closer to the two-edge sides of rodhr/b. 14:14pm fixed, should consider fixing the hex vtex. And change on-field-exit for book to save.15:20 removed all the actual rodhr/b tiles, because, no need for them. blue should be speed thing or mana thing, or ice thing, etc... and starting to destruct the carhold too. Added flat_c, tidied up the star pillar level. Should ground the clock. Many uses of popper in a short time could cause lightning storm or something.Koin still should auto absorb to inventory. Did sound change with gain altering? Yes. Just when you try to pick it up, you sometimes get what's behind it because the selcols are so thin, but widening them makes it a bit hard to navigate. They should really absorb.21:44pm added sku_207, filled southeast of Route No.7.23:57pm added s_22162... I think...

Notice chardust already using the shared function and drawing, but the destruction mechanic is also effective, you only notice drawing if you rotate fast while drawing so that the nodes aren't being dug.Maybe I should write down my real adventure. I am searching for the next bit of code for duster. But I am human, I am lurking in frogdooler of mcl, only reading at night, and now I've moved on to the poetry. A read through the acclaimed 'Adieu, Metropolis' reminds me of how I wanted to replace it with something vital, which I still hold, how I wanted it erased like the chalk on 'Order' but for the reason not that it is too final for the written word (I am sure this MidwestManifold is a star and a genius abandoning her (or his?) post) but because it was always intended that chalk go with a duster. I wrote an Analysis, Translation, and Conclusion to it, but none of these satisfy me in any meaningful way, and it was long ago, but the poem takes me to Metropolis, and the one I know is the one of 'Ratchet and Clank'. I have it, it's the only one I have in Japanese, on the ps2 emulator. Well it's an adventure now. I'm also holding a fag and sipping whiskey, but we'll deal with this method and its weaknesses later. I have a 'graffifi', a 'chalk' and a 'chardust', each progressively more custom stripped than the last, with a projected dual-to-merge version on the way, very slow to be given my energies as I embrace the meaning of the artefact. 13:32pm 16/6/25. The bottom line of 'her', MM, that AWOL poet, turns to political reflections, but the poem's meaning is not this, for I am still in the game, and read it in this pure way of value investment and finite interpretations. Finite in Complexity, I mean, but also as one who may write a poem myself. See the story of the poem is a fiction, but a heavy one, one that integrates terms of construction and doubt common in the game. Blatant questions I cannot ask in my natural energies at this time would be: what graffiti would be written in the world of 'Metropolis'?. Would that the creators of that catchy cat could have stopped to wonder that for us! I'll have to do all this myself, and the only credit due is that given to an unbeleiving thief! Visitor, not a thief. But the issue is with waiting for a cyborg that is flowingpoint to produce graffiti in this metropolis where the common man is in fact a zombie. Anyone with the force in them has some link to the outside. Don't I know it. but to see the art develop is to embrace the inner workings of these worlds, and to build like a spider on a web, with and onto the lines that are already cast. So I don't reach into politics if I am protecting the poem I hold in my hands. My cold steel cyborg hands. 13:45 controller fritzed.I have to, if this is going anywhere, actually study graffifi, or, more faithfully to my cause, chalk. The authenticity of the result depends on it. Otherwise I should just add cigarettes to the game, and I'm not siding with goblins if I want to see the exit any time soon. Powers are pulling either way, however. Thing is, what matters is the man being put down by the past cases, the scourge of muted working classes. the adventure is not replaceable by pure literary expression, this is not what flowingpoint represents, it is the worst case scenario, the one without hope, the gameless judgement, the cowardly one. I actually have to fight the machine a bit here. I want to know chalk properly and sincerely, and it is not an either/or through the portal. I am there, I am putting my word in either way, and it's going to look like the same word, isn't it? Because, maybe the dream logging gave me this. I am not saying Adieu to Metropolis. But it is the best poem I have read on the subject. Puts me on edge this. To wipe chalk without wiping the stone is historically faithful. It's a good balance of forces. The written character on a wall is not a goodbye this way, but a kind of temporary set-up, in its basest description, or a checkpoint of manifests, and of course a mark on the world through and through. 13:56. It's not where it's going, like the links that follow or the register beyond it, but the holds and the ends it will be. It's going to be cool, and everything is ready, but the merge is not ever straightforward where I can still think as I do it. And think I must. But better now that I think of the farewell to the city given, given prematurely with a stall-hardy failure to dust. A duster turns symbols to dust. Dusting should have particle effects much like popper/rubler I suppose. and it has to be 4x4 pixels large, it has to be easier to wipe the word than to swipe it, and I'm thinking of the careful messenger who, like MM, 'knows his song well before singing'. Apolitical for now, and never is it going to be a political move giving the people some tool for expression. At most a technical one, yeah. 14:02. And I can wait until the big brother vibe blows over also. But we have the goblins being put in camps to think of, don't we? The police state and the missing girl. Wildcats and towerlords shuffling the order about. A blazing ruin of RN06. We just don't have the next step.It's outside the box, of course! It's getting my hands on real chalk, or a duster for the whiteboard marker on the sofa, or a visit to a classroom, or a look at the current state of things, basically, since that's the eye in the sky draw-out you get a feeling of as a hero in here. It's not falling and flying anymore, because it's not love, it's business and cheating. Would that love could come first. And it does, I suppose, but you have to BE someone to experience it, and I'm just a point in a cyborg with a mission on the line. So I should investigate that great soap-opera 'The point and the Line: a love story', but ... what's the point? I wouldn't get it, would I? I'm more wizard than point on a line now let's be honest.11.12 21/Junechanged color of 'chalk' with canvas.lua[Ln133]'s draw_pixel function alone. Should use flowcharts to map dependencies.

Uh 12:37 ok, so removed defs everywhere cos they were in my way. giu.lua is out then. 12:50 removed draw_rect because there was only a definition of the function with no call in the already well-stripped chalk fodler set, but must investigate the excess chalking that is the drawing when dragging on a hold on left click over the etchable blocks around even when holding as active item something else like a regular block. But it's low priority, something to do with step, ETCH_STEP, that stuff.13:24 sorted the 'step' issue by ensuring player_lasts goes to nil if it's not chalk group item held in items.lua[L85] 13:35 it did not work as identifyer, just item or not. 14:00 ok chalk is in TJ, save the drag of a line for later.16:05 great idea, not sure how to do, but would be ideal if sketches made with the chalk, or some future chalk, on a block could stay with it when dug to the inventory for later re-placement. So you could just sketch whatever textures you want, and leave them somewhere for later placement as though they were already part of the registered node list.

Will have to start asking more questions in the maths universe, which seems so much greater since getting this connection going. I mean to deliver somewhat on 'equivolumetricity' and though it is obviously as simple as it gets, I believe it would bring me back to that bit of 'Magician' when Milamber pours water on the tiered fountain all day, to be eventually told by powers above that he's finally a magician. What a moment, because you're always up to that point looking forward to it. With the troll fight and the protecting the princess, and the going off to war with tomas and the other guy, martin? Yeah, those guys. It was not the most difficult suspended belief system, because there was so much actual narration. Or it was easy to hold a book about characters who grow through these stages that you can sort of observe alongside questions about how the magic works, or how fate demands things, or how the friendships last. Or 'endure'. Well, equivolumetricity is just constant volume laws in minetest for liquids. So I gotta be bold to march into core, and but to sup on the sweet nectar of my own creation, some heavily diluted contraband, which doesn't 'sit well' with the stones for the foreseeable future, unless... We are prepared to see some ugly accidents. I mean, it's easy to suggest say, 3 or 4 levels of overflow from an adjacent, over a partial volume, with simple intersection using blender, but the thing must rotate to accomodate complex builds, and the overflow must hold the level and the horizontality of the adjacent liquid. A comprehensive implementation of the simplest method (that worked for brushrock) with a augmentation of partial volumes with complements that adhere to field constraints takes as many alterations (possible with a 'wet' staff) as there are unique orientations of unique registered rocks, for each of these 3 or 4 afore-suggested levels. That could be about as many days I have left to live. So I'm not doing that, obviously. I'm smoking a bong. But that is only 'sitting well'. The real job is making graduated spread, in a square trough, under gravity, with unusual conditions: the water only moves in the sign of a cross, but at least it moves when it's changed to move rather than burst forth from a source, which should take me to those water-related abms in the core files, which should be a hefty and sizeable case of lua files to be examined, with the occasional 'dipping in' back to the game itself, where floatingpoint has a 'scary, angry, wicked' altar his rival wants him to destroy, windows have been installed, but no doors, where motivation is going to have me cross legged and chanting one of the days. 13:3114:43 having some fun with the witch's basement setup.18:50 Ubelievably, took much time moving stax's house to Order, stripped of furniture.

With Stax's house, though, it's a different feel. Ita also occurs that just watering the grass with popper is fun enough, and training enough with projectiles.Noticed the 'hui' rune is fudged: the rune doubles on toggle to glow but only one is lit, but it shouldn't double anyway.21:38 16/7/25 Well, I've got to split from the gits don't I? Dropped the bomb on them just now. Not that they'll notice.
