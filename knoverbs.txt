[] "You feel a tremor beneath your feet. An ancient stone hums with a 
faint, almost forgotten energy. What do you do?"
[a] "Tap the stone with your foot."
[b] "Speak randomly in the hopes that it will converse back."
[c] "Make some mental calculations."
[d] "Remember the old ways."
[a1] "Echoes… resonance… a forgotten language stirs within the stone."
[a1a] "Tap a jazzy groove."
[a1b] "Tap to an old classical."
[a1c] "Stop tapping. It knows you're here."
[a2] "The echoes are pleasing to the ear. Well done."
[b1] "The knowstone is clearly struggling with accurately 
following complex instructions. You aren't sure you're in control here. What do you do?"
[b1a] "Begin whispering your thoughts to close the subject."
[b1b] "Request a list of commands."
[b1c] "Wait. Keep talking anyway. But what are you saying?"
[b2] "Password is incorrect. Please try again later."
[b3] "Password accepted. Welcome back, Steve."
[c1] "Do you require anything in particular to go with that obsoletist drudgery?"
[c1a] "Should I?"
[c1b] "I hope not, this is basic physics. Real basic."
[c1c] "<Take offense>"
[d1] "Are we starting again?"
[d1a] "Is_end = true!"
[d1b] "Is_end = false... hmmm. That's new!"
[d1c] "Look, Knostone, you insulted me. How could you forget that?"
[a1a1] "What are you playing?"
[a1a1a] "I don't really know. Something blue though..."
[a1a1b] "In the beginning I was playing, the mood all changed..."
[a1a2] "The mysterious stone ceases its strange humming, as though listening."
[a1a3] "The Knostone glows radiantly, but since you can't seem to understand its purpose, you decide to abandon it and move on."
[a1b1] "What would you like me to play?"
[a1b2] "The knostone responds to the player's evocative 
melody with a simple instrumental whinny, indicating a receptive curiosity."
[a1b3] "The penultimate blaze of the mysterious stone's glowing rune is accompanied by the sound of a distant explosion. Then it asks: "What have I done?"
[a1b1a] "Actually could you shut up, I'm trying to concentrate."
[a1b1b] "Something from the early times, if you can."
[a1b1c] "I'm actually *trying* to turn you on!"
[a1c1] "You notice patterns on the walls. You don't like it."
[a1c2] "Someone, or some *thing*, is trying to distract you from your very important mission. They're very good."
[a1c3] "You're not giving anything away just yet."
[a1a1a1] "The music continues..."
[a1a1b1] "I don't have time for the whole rap, I'm outie!"
[a1a2] "The mysterious stone ceases its strange humming, as though listening."
[a1a3] "The Knostone glows radiantly, but since you can't seem to understand its purpose, you decide to abandon it and move on."
[b1a1] "It's like you're not there. Nothing happens."
[b1b1] "Yeah, but how?"
[b1c1] "You want me to take it from here, buddy?"
[c1a1] "..."
[c1b1] "I know physics. I'm the 'KNOWSTONE'! Ask me anything. I'll show you."
[c1c1] "I mean, like, in a nice way. Just trying to help..."
[d1a1] "Then take all the time in the world. Things are as they should be."
[d1b1] "Initiating backup world in 3... 2... 1..."
[d1c1] "Talk to the Echostone about your problems, ok?"
