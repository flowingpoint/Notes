So you know how if I catch a dog's tail and we're in a pool the dog can be tamed and evolved into a Morganite? 

How would we find out? If this is accurate.

Trigonometry?

The Blackpool waters are a closed system. Morganite is digital property now. 

Not if it's your dog! But you have to give him this collar.

The sapphire sunset badge! And the surreal teal tandem. 

With all of Morganite's physics? Biology? Chemistry? 

And account. But Morganite won't be doing any of it. With this.

The Huminer of Danke, ancient mortal modifier of mammalian morphology.

It makes him a dog again! Brilliant! But you have to realise both forms are categorically the same. The untamed Morganite is different. 

But does it leave?

Blackpool Network Flow will be examined. Pipes are not cheap. 

And when you're down there, get us something nice.

Like what?

You know. 

Ok.

It'll work.

I'll dig something up. Sure. Then we leave. 

Ok, alright, ok. 

Because they're not looking for us out there.
